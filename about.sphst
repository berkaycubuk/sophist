When it comes to building static websites, developers often find themselves weighing different
frameworks to determine which one best meets their needs. Among the many options available,
Hugo and Astro stand out as two powerful yet distinct tools. Today, we’ll explore the

title2 What is Static Site Generation

Before diving into the specifics of Hugo and Astro, it’s essential to
understand what static site generation (SSG) is and why it has become a popular choice for web development.

Static Site Generation is a method of creating websites where the web pages
are generated at build time, rather than on each user request. This contrasts
with traditional server-side rendering, where HTML is generated dynamically
on the server when a user visits a page.

Generating at build time comes with advantages like; performance, security
and simplicity.
